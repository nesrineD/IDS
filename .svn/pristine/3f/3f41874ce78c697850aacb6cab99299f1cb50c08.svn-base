\label{objectives}

	Based on the project goal which is to developed an IDS system to detect anomaly, potentially malicious, behaviours in an IT-system, various objectives were defined, which includes:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Extract relevant information from given data-sets}
		\item{Training of the IDS system using machine learning methods on the extracted information}
		\item{Testing of the IDS system on DARPA'$99$ data-sets}
	\end{itemize}
	
	These objectives merely serve as a rough guideline during the IDS-development process.\ A detailed approach taken by the authors in order to achieve the project goal is described and explained in the next chapter.
